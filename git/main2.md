# git note

It's recommanded to use [Gitkraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)ï¼Œwhich is more intuitively to check git history.

As more and more git commands are used by me, the old note became more like a git cocument. But the note should be based on use cases. So I decided to rewrite it.

## Initialization

```bash
git init
git init <dir>
```

## Config

```
